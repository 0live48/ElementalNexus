# Overview

For this sprint, my goal was to deepen my understanding of **JavaScript** by creating an interactive web-based feature that demonstrates core language concepts such as functions, DOM manipulation, events, and data handling. As a software engineer, I want to strengthen my ability to build responsive browser-based applications, since JavaScript is one of the most essential tools for modern development.

The software I created is a small demonstration program that runs entirely in the browser. It shows how JavaScript can dynamically update elements on a webpage, respond to user input, and process data. The purpose of writing this software was to gain hands-on experience with JavaScript syntax, logical structures, and real-time interaction between HTML, CSS, and JS.

The demo video includes the program running in the browser and a walkthrough of the code structure, explaining what I learned about JavaScript functions, event listeners, variables, arrays, and logical flow.

# Development Environment

I used **Visual Studio Code** as my main development tool, along with the Live Server extension to quickly test the webpage in the browser.
The core programming language for this sprint was **JavaScript**, which I used alongside simple **HTML** and **CSS** files. No external libraries were required, since the purpose was to demonstrate native JavaScript functionality.

# Future Work

- Add more complex interactions to showcase deeper JavaScript features such as classes or modules.
- Improve the UI design with animations or better styling.
- Expand the demo into a simple game or multi-page interactive experience.
