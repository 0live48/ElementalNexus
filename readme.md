# Overview

The Elemental Nexus Game is an interactive browser-based card game created to explore and demonstrate TypeScript and JavaScript programming concepts. The purpose of this project is to practice software development skills by implementing game mechanics, handling user input, and dynamically updating the webpage based on game logic. 

Players select from a hand of elemental cards, and the opponent draws cards as well. The game resolves elemental clashes based on predefined rules, with win, lose, and tie conditions. Players can see the current state of the game through interactive visuals, including a result text box, player and opponent hands, and the ability to play again after the game ends.

The goal is to gain hands-on experience with TypeScript, DOM manipulation, and implementing game logic while creating a functional online demo.

- **Code Editor:** Visual Studio Code  
- **Web Browser:** Google Chrome / Firefox for testing  
- **Languages Used:** TypeScript (transpiled to JavaScript), HTML5, CSS3  
- **Libraries:** None external; all DOM manipulation is done with vanilla TypeScript/JavaScript  
- **Other Tools:** Live Server extension in VS Code for live preview of HTML and game behavior
