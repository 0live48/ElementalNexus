# Overview

The *Elemental Nexus* game is a browser-based turn-based card game where players select elemental cards to battle an opponent. In this sprint, I focused on integrating a **Cloud Database** to store player data, including names, scores, and game progress. The game now saves leaderboard information remotely, allowing data to persist between sessions and across devices.

The purpose of this software is to explore **cloud data integration** and learn how to connect client-side game logic with remote storage. Users can play the game in the browser, and after each match, the game updates the cloud database with their scores automatically. Additionally, players can download a CSV of leaderboard results to view and share their performance.

# Cloud Database

For this sprint, I used **Google Sheets as a Cloud Database** via Google Apps Script. This free solution allows me to store structured data in a spreadsheet while exposing a simple REST API endpoint to interact with the game.

**Database Structure:**
- **Sheet Name:** `Leaderboard`
- **Columns:**
  - `Name` – Player name
  - `Score` – Player score
  - `Date` – Date of the match

The game interacts with the sheet through a deployed Google Apps Script endpoint. Each time a player finishes a game, their name and score are sent to the cloud database via a POST request. Scores can also be retrieved via a GET request to render the leaderboard in real time.

# Future Work

- Add authentication so players can track progress across sessions
- Improve error handling for API requests to the cloud database
- Add additional player statistics (wins, losses, deck composition)
- Explore moving to a full SQL or NoSQL cloud solution for scalability
- Implement real-time multiplayer using the cloud database for state synchronization
